# Work Test Process

I have not created a REST API backend service before, nor have I worked in Postgres.
So this was a challenge not in writing code but in learning about these processes
within the time allotted to me.

I am comfortable in the Node.js and NPM environment and I have experimented with the Express package before,
so this felt like a good place to start. And doing things in TypeScript would help by just having the type definitions of new packages.

# Breakdown

The first step was to read through the task ("email") and define:

- What is the product?
- What features are asked for, or implied?
- What tech stack is asked for, or implied?

## The product

It should be a backend built in Node.js and here I take the freedom of coding in TypeScript,
using a transpiler to deploy JavaScript code.

## The features

Lorem ipsum

## The tech stack

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- REST support
- Postgres database
- Checksum Generator
- (Optional): gRPC support
