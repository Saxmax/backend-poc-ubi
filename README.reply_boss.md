# Email Reply to 'Boss'

Hi Boss,

Fortunately I was able to allocate enough time to draft up a PoC that should provide what you need to showcase.
It is a bit crude under the hood but the service itself works fantastically.
I managed to persist the data so you can safely exit and resume the presentation with all previous data still there.

As requested it has been constructed in a way we can rapidly implement additional features - such as support for gRPC,
and device protocol handling.

It automatically updates the health of all devices periodically without shutting down,
as this was quicker to get up and running instead of implementing retries.
I hope this is sufficient, please let me know if you encounter any issues you would
like me to address, I am available if you need me.

You can find the application instructions and download URL attached to this email.

Regards,
Max
